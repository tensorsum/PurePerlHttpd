Code written in 1998. It's an HTTP server (like Apache) only it's written in Perl (no extra modules). 
Because of the way it's written, it was possible to run it on UNIX/Windows and modify it easily. 
Several people took it and turned into something more complex.

I've written several HTTP servers after that, some in Java (with embedded XML/XSL processing) some in ANSI C. 
This one was the first HTTP server that I wrote and it still make sense, actually.
